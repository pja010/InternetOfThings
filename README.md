## What is the Internet of Things?

An IoT device can be defined as a single-pursposed, computer-powered and network-connected object that _interacts with the physical world_. It is controlled by and interacted with remotely through another device, such as a laptop or smartphone. IoT devices merge together the physical and the digital, allowing us to control, automate and collect data from the spaces we live in. Examples include dishwashers, laundry machines, and manufacturing robots empowered by embedded computers with internet connection.
