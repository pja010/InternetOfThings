## What is the Internet of Things?

An IoT device can be defined as a type of computer-powered and network-connected object with a single purpose that interacts with the physical world. It is controlled by and interacted with remotely through another device, such as a laptop or smartphone. IoT devices merge together the physical and the digital world, allowing us to control, automate and collect data from the spaces we live in. Examples include dishwashers, laundry machines, and manufacturing robots empowered by embedded computers with internet connection.
